# mcpi
Collection of Minecraft Pi scripts and stuff from current projects

This is a collection of small Python programmes for controlling events in Minecraft Pi; these are all very much lifted from other people's work with only slight amendments by me to update to my current version of Python or simple hacks to get past errors I don't have the expertise to fix yet. All original creators are credited in file - if you use and modify any of these please make sure you leave the attribution statements in place.

If you are the original creator of anything on here and haven't been credited or aren't happy with the existing attribution, please get in touch and let me know.

Getting started ... you should definitely go to this tutorial:
http://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2014/05/how-to-setup-the-minecraft-python-api-on-a-raspberry-pi/

This will get you using the API to create a simple event (using code to place a simple stone block) and also contains a reference guide to the different block IDs and links to other similarly useful resources. One of those, this tutorial by Martin O'Hanlon, will also help you play with the different commands available and see what the API can help you to do.
