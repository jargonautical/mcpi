# mcpi
Collection of Minecraft Pi scripts and stuff from current projects

This is a collection of small Python programmes for controlling events in Minecraft Pi; these are all very much lifted from other people's work with only slight amendments by me to update to my current version of Python or simple hacks to get past errors I don't have the expertise to fix yet. All original creators are credited in file - if you use and modify any of these please make sure you leave the attribution statements in place.
